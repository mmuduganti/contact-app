Feature: Contact Management service
  In order to manage my contacts
  As a user
  I want to add/edit/view my contacts


  Scenario: Create a contact
  # What is Scenario
  #To actually express the behavior we want, each feature contains several scenarios.
  #Each scenario is a single concrete example of how the system should
  #behave in a particular situation. If you add together the behavior defined by
  #all of the scenarios, thatâ€™s the expected behavior of the feature itself.

  #Each scenario must make sense and be able to be executed independently of
  #any other scenario.
